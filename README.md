# Anomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks 

Anomaly   detection   refers   to   the   problem   of   finding   patterns   in   data   which   fail   to   conform   to   the  
expected   standard.   These   anomalous   patterns   is   useful   to   a   number   of   business   applications,  
such   as   identifying   trending   topics   on   social   media   and   suspicious   traffic   on   computer   networks,  
as well as detecting credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and e­auction fraud. 
 
There   are   a   variety   of   anomaly   detection   algorithms   available,   and   the   correct   one   to   use  
depends   on   the   type   of   anomaly   you   are   trying   to   detect.   A   few   examples   are   point   anomalies,  
contextual   anomalies,   and   collective   anomalies.   This   project   will   be   focused   on   anomaly  
detection   in   time   evolving   graphs.   Various   methods   have   been   explored,   including   time   series  
models,   similarity­based   algorithms,   and   community­based   algorithms.   Evaluation   of   these  
approaches   is   often   not   straightforward   because   of   the   lack   of   ground   truth   data.   However,   we  
can   compare   the   detected   anomalies   with   normal   time   points   in   the   dataset,   or   compare   results  
among different methods in order to evaluate the performance of the methods indirectly.
